***** note to VIM 7 users ! *****
Version 7 of vim integrates a native spellchecker which outperforms  vimspell script.
As such I will not maintain anymore vimspell script, and you are advised to delete all
related files from your plugin/ and doc/ directory, and use the native spellchecker instead.
******************************

This script is based on Claudio Fleiner's spell checker and uses ispell (or aspell) 
to highlight spelling errors, and provides mappings (including a popup menu opened 
by right clicking on a mispelled word) to correct them, with suggestions. 

It is possible to set up the script to do automatic spellchecking (Ã  la
word --- the current visible window is checked, and errors are highlighted on the fly).
For that, just redefine the spell_auto_type variable (let spell_auto_type="tex,doc,mail") in such a maner 
that all the filetypes for which you want on the fly spell check are listed ("none", and "all" token are treated).
     
Much more documentation on all options can be found at the beginning of the script, or 
after having install it, by typing the command ":help vimspell".

Feedback (suggestions, bug report, questions,...) is welcome ....
